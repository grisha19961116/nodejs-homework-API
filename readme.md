Homework number 3 ,I have to use ODM mongoDb and mongoose for set portal between them like on previous homework when i used local db when i saved data local with fs.readFile and write file in json format.Also i have changed structure about logic introduced controllers and divide with bigger abstraction than it was for understanding and easy support.Did some fix with validation and create Schema for mongoose with additional validation fields like objectId() into Schema files.
